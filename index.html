    <h1>lazylemur776 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a student at the Lemur University of Rhode Island currently studying User
        Interfaces and User Experience. I'm interested in the intersection of design and technology, and my core design
        principles are simplicity, accessibility, and inclusivity.

    <p>
        In this project, I construct two personas of users of my dishwasher with corresponding empathy maps based on
        data collected from multiple observation sessions in my apartment's kitchen in Providence. I also present a
        storyboard depicting the process by which a certain user persona might use my dishwasher.

    <p>
        In this project, I practiced the workflow of redesigning a simple website. I exercised my skills in analyzing
        and identifying flaws in an existing interface, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various
        screen sizes, and building a responsive website based on those prototypes.

    <p>
        In this project, I worked with in a team of four to design a website for a real-world startup that provides a
        platform for helping workers unionize their workplace. I practiced the workflow of iterative design and
        evaluation by creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, conducting usability tests, and iterating on
        the design based on the results of the tests.

    <p>
        In this project, I created this portfolio website to showcase my work from this course. This website is
        supposed to showcase what makes me unique and how I can build my narrative.
